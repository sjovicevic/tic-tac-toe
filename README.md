# Introduction 

Repository name is pretty self-explanatory, my goal is to create Tic Tac Toe game.
Game will be developed in four stages. 
The game will mostly be developed in modules, even if there is no reason behind that. I want to simulate working on a really big project and keeping it neat. 

# Progress 

## Stage 1

Drawing game board - Tic Tac Toe board size is 3x3 but the plan is to develop independent .py module for creating boards.
This is done because of later use of boards (for example in creating games like *Chess* (8x8), *Go* (19x19), etc.)

## Stage 2

Purpose of Stage 2 is to simply check whether there is a winner or not. Going through the board and checking if there is columns, rows or diagonals with 3 same numbers.

## Stage 3

User input handling.

## Stage 4

Final stage, finishing the game, and adding all little details game needs. Adding try, exceptions, making modules and checking if everything is all right.


# Idea

Whole internet is cluttered with ideas for Python beginner projects, Tic Tac Toe is one oft-recurring. Idea is from practicepython.org, also [stages of development](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/27/24-draw-a-game-board.html) are similar with what practicepython.org recommended. 

# Summary 

This project is for self-learning purpose, developing my Python skills and learning to document the code. Learning more about modules and functional programming. Trying to use as many advanced features Python can provide.
