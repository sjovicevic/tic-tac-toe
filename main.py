# 1st stage - drawing a board game
# 2nd stage - check tic tac toe
# 3rd stage - tic tac toe draw 
# 4th stage - finalization and adding details

            Tic-tac-toe or Xs and Os is a game for two players, X and O, 
            who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
            The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks
            in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
            Marking is done with x,y format where x is row number, y is column number.

            e.g. 
            
            Player 1 (X) >>> 2,3
        
        """)

# testing finished, hopefully everything works!
